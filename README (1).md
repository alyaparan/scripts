### Notes:
- The "Install Script" button uses a shield.io badge style for visual appeal and links directly to the raw script file on GitHub.
- Tampermonkey will automatically handle the installation when the button is clicked, as long as the extension is installed .
- For browsers without Tampermonkey, the button will redirect to the raw script file, which may prompt a download or display the code. Users can manually copy and paste this into Tampermonkey if needed .

Let me know if you need further adjustments!
